Welcome to my repo for a very unusual project. None of the files stored here will make any sense unless you read this, so allow me to explain what this project is all about.

Every Wednesday night in the summer, my local yacht club has a sailboat race. The rules are pretty straightforward (fastest time wins), but there's one big problem: all the racers sail different boats. This creates a significant advantage for some racers (since some boats are faster than others), so what can we do about it? The answer is the Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) system.

PHRF is a handicapping system that assigns a numerical rating to individual sailboats based on their performance relative to a theoretical sailboat. The goal is to level the playing field so that, in theory, a boat's corrected race results represent the skill of the captain and crew separate from the ability of the sailboat.

Wouldn't it be interesting to compare PHRF ratings in my club with race results? That's the point of this project. I obtained PDFs containing race results and PHRF ratings for every yacht club on Lake Ontario and used them to examine whether better rated sailboats perform better in races.

The actual analysis is not very complicated, since I want to be able to share something simple with the sailors at my club. The real challenge of this project is parsing the 150 PDF files. PDFs are a nightmare to parse, but you can examine the files in this repo to see how I did it. Enjoy!
